Create a full-stack Docker GUI app that users can install on Ubuntu/Debian with a single curl command. The project must include:

1. **Repository Structure**:
   - `/backend` → Node.js backend using Dockerode to manage Docker containers (list, pull, start, stop, remove containers and images). Backend runs on port 3001.
   - `/frontend` → React frontend that shows available Docker apps, running containers, allows users to pull images, start/stop containers, and view logs. Frontend runs on port 8080 using `serve`.
   - `install.sh` → One-line installer script that:
     - Installs Docker, Node.js, and npm.
     - Adds the current user to the Docker group.
     - Clones the repo to `/opt/docker-gui`.
     - Installs backend dependencies and sets up a systemd service for the backend.
     - Builds frontend and sets up a systemd service to serve the frontend via `serve`.
     - Outputs backend URL (`http://localhost:3001`) and frontend URL (`http://localhost:8080`) after installation.

2. **Backend Requirements**:
   - Use Dockerode to manage Docker.
   - Expose REST API endpoints:
     - `GET /containers`
     - `GET /images`
     - `POST /pull` → pull Docker image
     - `POST /containers` → create/start container
     - `POST /containers/:id/start`
     - `POST /containers/:id/stop`
     - `DELETE /containers/:id`
   - Use Express.js.

3. **Frontend Requirements**:
   - React-based GUI.
   - Display list of containers and images.
   - Pull new images by entering the image name.
   - Start/stop/remove containers with buttons.
   - Use Axios to call the backend API.

4. **Installer Script** (`install.sh`) Requirements:
   - Must be runnable with `curl -sSL <URL> | bash`.
   - Installs all dependencies automatically.
   - Sets up backend and frontend as systemd services so they run on boot.
   - No Nginx required; frontend is served via Node (`serve -s build -l 8080`).

5. **Output**:
   - A fully working repository with backend, frontend, and installer ready to push to GitHub.
   - Make sure all paths, ports, and commands work on Ubuntu/Debian.
